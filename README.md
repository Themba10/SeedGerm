# Seed Germination System(Mini Greenhouse)

Short description or introduction of the project.

## Project Description

The SEED GERMINATION SYSTEM is a project designed to meet the growers needs. Whether you are growing fruits, vegetables or herbs the Seed Germination system is designed to meet your needs. Acquiring this system will be beneficial to the farmers of both local and commercial farming. 
The system is designed with the focus on starting seeds and making the flowering and the next growth stages efficient. As stated by the ScienceDirect forum, germination is the most important stage in a plant life cycle.  

The project may be implemented in an automated greenhouse, the restriction for this project is that it is only allowed for the start and end of germination. After the seeds have sprouted and completed the process of germination, further stages will need to be done in a bigger environment such as a greenhouse or outdoors. 
The project features include monitoring and temperature control by either heating or cooling the system, humidifier monitoring and control for control the environment's humidity and remote control from a computer or mobile device. 

## Usage

The Mini Greenhouse system is designed to facilitate the growing process of plants from germination to the vegetative stage. The system utilizes a combination of hardware components and software control to create an optimized environment for plant growth. 
The purpose of the Mini Greenhouse system is to provide users with an automated solution for starting the growing process of plants. It incorporates various sensors to monitor crucial parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, water level, and light intensity. The software, running on a Raspberry Pi with Flask, allows users to view real-time sensor data, adjust settings, and control the watering system. 

The Mini Greenhouse system was developed by a team of developers using C++ and Python programming languages. The hardware components include a Raspberry Pi for running the main control software, an Arduino Uno for sensor data collection, and various sensors such as the Capacitive soil moisture sensor, DBS120 for soil temperature measurement, Ultrasonic sensor for water level detection, and an LDR sensor for light measurement.
